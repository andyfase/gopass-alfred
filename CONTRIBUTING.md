`gopass-alfred` uses GitHub to manage reviews of pull requests.

* If you have a trivial fix or improvement, go ahead and create a pull request.

* If you plan to do something more involved, first raise an issue to discuss
  your idea. This will avoid unnecessary work.

  The gopass-alfred code must be fully reviewable also when installed as extension.
  Keep your code as simple as possible.
